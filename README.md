## INTRODUCTION

The Ck5 accordion open/closed module is a Drupal 10 / 11 module that adds an accordion that
can be open or closed, which is controlled via a setting.

Made as an update of an internal module. You are likely much better off using the
contributed https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor_accordion module, all though
this does not have an option to open or close per accordion.
